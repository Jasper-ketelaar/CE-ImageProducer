## Introduction

The paper by A. Dhall et al. [1] presents a set of methods for leveraging information about the semantic hierarchy embedded in class labels. They argue that there has been limited work in using unconventional, external guidance other than traditional image-label pairs for training. They model the label-label and label-image interactions using order-preserving embeddings governed by both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries, prevalent in natural language, and tailor them to hierarchical image classification and representation learning. They empirically validate the models on the hierarchical ETHEC dataset. Here is the image below provided by the authors describing the hierarchy of the dataset:
